    "**Install Notes:**\n",
    "- Numpy\n",
    "  - Numpy is 1.23.0\n",
    "  - scipy wants < 1.23.0\n",
    "  - numba wants < 1.21\n",
    "- daal4py\n",
    "  - wants daal==2021.2.3 (which isn't installed)\n",
    "- Plotly\n",
    "  - may need to install to utilize some of the interactive figures\n",

    "**DataFrame Prep:**\n",
    "- Needs Pandas dataframe with 2 columns:\n",
    "  - 'ds': datestamp that pandas recognizes\n",
    "    - Says preferrably YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for timestamp, but hoping it takes time zone aware stuff\n",
    "  - 'y': the target variable we want to forecast\n",
    "    - if these are the only inputs, then I wonder if we can include temperatures :(\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross_valdiation:**\n",
    "- Parameters:\n",
    "  - horizon: forecast time period (3 days?)\n",
    "  - initial: initial training period (3 years? - minimum training window?)\n",
    "  - period: spacing between cutoff dates\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - from prophet.diagnostics import cross_validation\n",
    "  - df_cv = cross_validation(m, initial='730 days', period='180 days', horizon = '365 days')\n",

    "- Looks like we should be able to add weather data via add_regressors\n",

    "  - Non-continuous variable: would need to bucket temperatures:\n",
    "    - Maybe: is hot day? or is cold day?\n",
    "    - Should this is hot/is cold be based on time of day?  would need to see inflection point for that\n"
